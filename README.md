# Ciphers
Collection of cryptography ciphers

### Affine Cipher
 - Takes a message and two integer keys that are used to encrypt the message using arithmetic and modulo

### Caesar Cipher (Shift)
 - Takes a message and encryptes it by shifting the alpha bet n (n being the input key) times

### Vigenere Cipher
 - Takes a message and encryptes it by using a key file and arithmetic and modulo

### Substitution Cipher
 - Takes a message and encryptes it by using a key file with plaintext
 - It uses the first 26 characters as its new alphabet and switches from the english alphabet to said key alphabet
 - For this to work properly, the key file needs to be 26 letters long and each letter is unique
